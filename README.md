Apart from this text file, this folder should contain a .jar executable file, a .app executable file and a folder called ‘res’. 
If you are using a Mac you may run the .app file as it runs smoother. 
Otherwise you may use the .jar file which runs on all operating systems with JRE 1.4+.

NOTE: 
Please do not move any of the source files.
